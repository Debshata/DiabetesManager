# 💡 DiabetesManager – Smart Diabetes Management with AI

**DiabetesManager** is an AI-powered web application designed to help users manage diabetes more effectively through smart tracking, personalized diet and exercise plans, and instant analysis of blood sugar reports using **Gemini API**.

> 🔬 Developed as part of the **Edunet Foundation - Microsoft Internship** on **Foundations of Artificial Intelligence** (April 2025).

---

## 🚀 Features

- **📊 Smart Tracking:** Visualize blood sugar levels, medications, and health metrics on a clean dashboard.
- **🧠 AI-Powered Analysis:** Upload medical reports (PDF) and get instant insights using Google’s Gemini AI.
- **🥗 Personalized Plans:** Generate tailored diet and exercise recommendations based on ethnicity, medication, allergies, and lifestyle data.

---

## 🔗 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Database:** SQLite
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API
- **Deployment-ready:** Localhost / Cloud-compatible

---

## 🤖 How Gemini API is Used

The core AI engine is built on **Gemini API**, which performs the following:

- Extracts and interprets text data from uploaded blood sugar reports
- Identifies **patterns, trends, and anomalies** in blood glucose levels
- Suggests **personalized interventions** for diet and exercise
- Simulates a physician-like assistant to deliver **AI-generated insights** in natural language

This aligns with **Week 3 and Week 4** of the internship curriculum:
- **Week 3:** Introduction to GenAI, Azure Demos, and image/text processing
- **Week 4:** Neural Networks, Deep Learning Hands-On, and Student Project Demo
